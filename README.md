# e-rommerce

This "e-commerce" should carry out next requirements:

 - inventory/warehouse management
 - goods management

[//]: # ( - direct chat client with support?)

Just some current tech doc:
 - Category. Service as a collection for products, and can be nested.
 - Product.

[//]: # ( - Group and GroupOptions. They are intended to show some variations in general of the same product, but may be different specs.)
[//]: # ( - ProductFilter &#40;category related&#41; and ProductFilterOption. So, this is actually intended for filtering of product &#40;i.e. processors: amount of cores, amount of threads, core frequency, manufacturer, etc.&#41;)
